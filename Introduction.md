# Religious Language in Farewell Letters

This repository contains the scripts and data I used for my thesis on religious language in farewell letters that were written by members of the Dutch resistance during the Second World War. The repository includes three folders, which contain the data or the letters I used for my thesis, the R scripts I used for the computational analysis of the sources and the results generated by these scripts. 

## 1. Data

The folder data contains the letters I used for my thesis from both collection 249 (farewell letters) and 247 (correspondence).

- **txts-collection-247-correspondence:**
  Contains text files with correspondence documents.

- **txts-collection-249-farewell-letters:**
  Contains text files with farewell letters.
  - **complete-collection:**
    Contains all original documents without duplicates.
  - **only-letters-without-duplicates:**
    Contains only farewell letters without duplicates.

## 2. Scripts

This directory contains the R scripts I used, as explained in the third chapter.

- **psalm_tf_idf_boxplot:**
  - **Description:** Creates boxplots comparing the relevance of Psalms words between farewell letters and correspondence using TF-IDF.
  - **Usage:** Loading farewell letters and correspondence; requires computation of term frequency and inverse document frequency.
  - **Note:** Provides insight into the importance of Psalms words in both types of documents.

- **psalm_quadgrams_bar_chart:**
  - **Description:** Visualizes the frequency of Psalms 4-grams in farewell letters.
  - **Usage:** Requires text tokenization and analysis of 4-grams.
  - **Note:** Displays the most common 4-grams per letter and their frequency.

- **religious_lexicon_boxplot:**
  - **Description:** Generates boxplots comparing the frequency of religious words between farewell letters and correspondence.
  - **Usage:** Requires custom lexicons for religious words and input from farewell letters and correspondence.
  - **Note:** Analyzes the usage of religious language and visualizes the results.

## Instructions

To run the scripts and reproduce the analysis:

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name

2. **Install required packages in R:**
Ensure you have the necessary R packages installed. You can do this by executing the following line in R:
install.packages(c("package1", "package2", ...))
Replace `package1`, `package2`, etc. with the actual packages needed for the scripts.

3. **Modify and execute the scripts:**
Before executing the scripts, modify the file paths to point to your input data files.

## 3. Results

In this folder you can find the visual representations generated by the scripts.
