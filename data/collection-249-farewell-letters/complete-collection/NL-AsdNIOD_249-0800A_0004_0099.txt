that I will see you all again. One last
tender kiss from your son Kees.
Father, forgive me too. Be strong
in your belief which I know you have
like Mother. Do not mourn, but
thank God that we may have the
certainty of His grace. Do not say:
Because you are gone péace can be
no joy sor us any more, because
after all, I gave my lise for my coun-
try, as so many are doing at this
time. Give me a firm handshake.
God's will be done.
Jan, Bep. El and Fien — greetings
to you all. Be strong and pray to
God for fortitude. Believe in Him
and He will make everything come
right. Be good to Father and Mother.
Many kisses from your brother Kees:
Greet my little brothers and sisters;
maybe they won't understand it so
well yet but teach them, too, to
believe.
Greet everybody, sor the sour of
us. My sincere thanks sor all they
ever did sor me.
We are courageous. Be the same.
They can only take our bodies. Our
souls are in God's hands. That should
be sufficient consolation.
I am going — until we meet again
in a reunion which will be so much
happier. May God bless vou all.
Have no hate. I die without
hatred. God rules everything
