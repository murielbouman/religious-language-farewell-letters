I Die at Dawn'

nis sincere and moving document was
written by a 22-ycar-old Dutch lad just
before he and his three companions were
chot to death, on February 27, by
German siring squad.
Their crime: escaping from Holland in
an attemnt to join the Dutch forces in
Britain. The four young men were cap-
tured in Occupied France, and for "as
sisting the encmy” were sentenced to
death by a German Military Court on
February 13, 1942.
At the suggestion of the Netherlands
Information Bureau, the remuneratior
paid for this letter by This Weck and
The Reader's Digest has been invested
in U. S. War Bonds, being held in
trust by the Dutch government until
Holland is liberated, when the money will
be turned over to the boy's parente.
EAR FATHER: It is difficult for
me to write this letter to you
but I have to tell you that
the military court has pronounced a
very heavy sentence upon us.
Read this letter alone, and then
tell Mother carefully.
When I wrote you besore on the
14th of February, we already knew
that we had been condemned to
death. But I could not find the
courage to write you this because l
didn't want vou to go through the
same time of tension. An appeal for
mercy, sent in our behalf to Paris,
was denied, although we thought we
stood a good chance because our case
was not, after all, a crime.
I do not say a time of sear, sor
fortunately it hasn't been that.1
have been able to pray much, and
have the firm conviction that I may
look forward to a death in Christ.
In a little while at five o'clock it is
going to happen and that is not so
terrible. It is, after all, only one mo¬
ment, and then I shall be with God
no more terrible miseries and the
sadness of this carth. Is that, after
all, such a dreadful transition?
On the contrary, it is beautisul to
be in God's strength. God has told us
that He will not forsake us if only we
pray to Him for support. I feel so
strongly my nearness to God I am
sully prepared to die. I hope that will
be a consolation to vou.
I know quite well that it is horri¬
ble. We are still so young. But God
knows that our cause was a just onc.
I think it is much worse for you than
for me because I know that I have
confessed all my sins to Him and
have become very quiet. Therefore
do not mourn, but trust in God and
pray for strength.
Mother, dear Mother, let me em-
brace you. Forgive me any wrong I
may have done. Do not cry, darling.
Be courageous. You still have chil¬
dren left — unlike Mrs. L. I know
