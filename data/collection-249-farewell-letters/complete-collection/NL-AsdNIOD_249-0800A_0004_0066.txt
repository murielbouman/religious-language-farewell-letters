I Die at Dawn'
Reprinted from This Week, New York Herald Tribune
Kees X.
JnIs sincere and moving document was
written by a 22-year-old Dutch lad just
before he and his three companions were
shot to death, on February 27, by a
German firing squad.
Their crime: escaping from Holland in
an attempt to join the Dutch forces in
Britain. The four young men were cap¬
tured in Occupied France, and for “as¬
sisting the enemy” were sentenced to
death by a German Military Court on
February 13, 1942.
At the suggestion of the Netherlands
Information Bureau, the remuneration
paid for this letter by This Week and
The Reader's Digest has been invested
in U. S. War Bonds, being held in
trust by the Dutch government until
Holland is liberated, when the money will
be turned over to the boy’s parents.
EAR FATHER: It is difficult for
me to write this letter to you
but I have to tell you that
the military court has pronounced a
very heavy sentence upon us.
Read this letter alone, and then
tell Mother carefully.
When I wrote you before on the
14th of February, we already knew
that we had been condemned to
death. But I could not find the
courage to write you this because I
didn’t want you to go through the
same time of tension. An appeal for
mercy, sent in our behalf to Paris,
was denied, although we thought we
stood a good chance because our case
was not, after all, a crime.
I do not say a time of fear, for
fortunately it hasn’t been that.
have been able to pray much, and
have the firm conviction that I may
look forward to a death in Christ.
In a little while at five o’clock it is
going to happen and that is not so
terrible. It is, after all, only one mo¬
ment, and then I shall be with God
no more terrible miseries and the
sadness of this earth. Is that, after
all, such a dreadful transition?
On the contrary, it is beautiful to
be in God’s strength. God has told us
that He will not forsake us if only we
pray to Him for support. I feel so
strongly my nearness to God I am
fully prepared to die. I hope that will
be a consolation to you.
I know quite well that it is horri¬
ble. We are still so young. But God
knows that our cause was a just one.
I think it is much worse for you than
for me because I know that I have
confessed all my sins to Him and
have become very quiet. Therefore
do not mourn, but trust in God and
pray for strength.
Mother, dear Mother, let me em¬
brace you. Forgive me any wrong I
may have done. Do not cry, darling.
Be courageous. You still have chil¬
dren left — unlike Mrs. L. I know
that I will see you all again. One last
tender kiss from your son Kees.
Father, forgive me too. Be strong
in your belief which I know you have
like Mother. Do not mourn, but
thank God that we may have the
certainty of His grace. Do not say:
Because you are gone peace can be
no joy for us any more,” because
after all, I gave my life for my coun¬
try, as so many are doing at this
time. Give me a firm handshake.
God’s will be done.
Jan, Bep, El and Fien — greetings
to you all. Be strong and pray to
God for fortitude. Believe in Him
and He will make everything come
right. Be good to Father and Mother.
Many kisses from your brother Kees;
Greet my little brothers and sisters;
maybe they won’t understand it so
well yet but teach them, too, to
believe.
Greet everybody, for the four of
us. My sincere thanks for all they
ever did for me.
We are courageous. Be the same.
They can only take our bodies. Our
souls are in God’s hands. That should
be sufficient consolation.
Tam going — until we meet again
in a reunion which will be so much
happier. May God bless you all.
Have no hate. I die without
hatred. God rules everything.
